This contains the general structure for the  neural network format

#AP_precdict
This contains our APS neural network
- It has two layers. 
- It has 74 inputs
- Therefore the file has 
	- 74 -> No of inputs
        - 1  -> no of outputs
        - 2  -> 2 hidden layers
        - 8  -> Neurons in the first hidden layer
        - 8  -> neurons in the second hidden layer
