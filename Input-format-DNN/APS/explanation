#We are using the format developed by Souradeep Dutta

The input format for a feedforward neural network has been described in the 
sherlock-network format. 

This is the .nt format

The basic essence of the format is that the neural network should be returned
in the format:


No of inputs
No of outputs
No of hidden layers
No of neurons in layer 1
No of neurons in layer 2 and so on

Every .nt file describes the neural network that contains it's weights, 
and bias.
