Experiment-2

Following the same instructions as the previous instructions.

Task 2A) Find the deltas for two inputs at a time to vary the output of the model. 

Same columns as before

Input(n, n+1)  Delta change  New input (n,n+1) Output-change Time


Task 2B) Now do the same for every two combinations of inputs and record the above data 
with the amount of time required for the same. 


Hypothesis: Does changing two inputs take more or less time than when we are trying  to find 
only one delta
