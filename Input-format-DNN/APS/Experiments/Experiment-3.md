Experiment-3
  
Following the same instructions as the previous instructions.

Task 3A) Find the deltas for two inputs at a time to vary the output of the model.

Same columns as before

Input(n, n+1, n+2)  Delta change  New input (n,n+1, n+2) Output-change Time


Task 3B) Now do the same for every two combinations of inputs and record the above data
with the amount of time required for the same.


Hypothesis: Does changing three inputs take more or less time than when we are trying  to find
only one delta or two delta. 

This is very important to understand since how much does an attacker need to vary to change the outcome?

Is one FDI enough to cause damage???
