Experiment-1

The experiments in this case have to be slightly different from the previous one. 

In the first experiment we would first want to find some feasible inputs. 
The work in this particular experiment has more pre-processing work before
moving to the next phase. 

The pre-processing work requires the following tasks:

Task 1A) Find 1 feasible input-output values required to find the time. 

The table should look like

	Input -1 | Input -2 | ...|Input-n | Output -1 | Output-2 | Output-3 | Time -taken to compute

Task 1B) Find multiple input-output pairs (perhaps 5-10?) - I think this depends on the time 
required to compute the Task 1A. If it is not taking hours and hours to compute then I'd prefer
if we can get 50-100 pairs for our data set. 


  Construct a similar table as above with same coloumns and infact keep adding to the same table 



Side note: The reason I feel this is an interesting thing too because we are basically constructing a 
data-set from the model. If the numbers are good, this can be a side paper that we can upload where
we say that we produce data-sets based on the model. I'll explain why this is the state-of-the art if you
are interested. 

Task 1C) Now that we have our data set ready, make a input-1.csv file in the format that the Gurobi can take
in as inputs and we can start finding the FDI attacks.

In the end there should be two files: the first file with input, output and the time. 
In the second file there should be: only the inputs 


Things I expect that we will find out after this experiment:
- The bounds on the outputs 
- The input ranges
- The input-output mappings 
- Finally, the time required in order to do so.
