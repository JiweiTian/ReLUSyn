File format of .nnet
The file begins with header lines, some information about the network architecture, normalization information, and then model parameters. Line by line:

1: Header text. This can be any number of lines so long as they begin with "//"
2: Four values: Number of layers, number of inputs, number of outputs, and maximum layer size
3: A sequence of values describing the network layer sizes. Begin with the input size, then the size of the first layer, second layer, and so on until the output layer size
4: A flag that is no longer used, can be ignored
5: Minimum values of inputs (used to keep inputs within expected range)
6: Maximum values of inputs (used to keep inputs within expected range)
7: Mean values of inputs and one value for all outputs (used for normalization)
8: Range values of inputs and one value for all outputs (used for normalization)
9+: Begin defining the weight matrix for the first layer, followed by the bias vector. The weights and biases for the second layer follow after, until the weights and biases for the output layer are defined.

The minimum/maximum input values are used to define the range of input values seen during training, which can be used to ensure input values remain in the training range. Each input has its own value.

The mean/range values are the values used to normalize the network training data before training the network. The normalization substracts the mean and divides by the range, giving a distribution that is zero mean and unit range. Therefore, new inputs to the network should be normalized as well, so there is a mean/range value for every input to the network. There is also an additional mean/range value for the network outputs, but just one value for all outputs. The raw network outputs can be re-scaled by multiplying by the range and adding the mean.
